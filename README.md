# Kintsugi

Kintsugi is the legendary japanese art of repairing vases with gold, not to hide imperfections but to tell its story. In this game, you're a pot maker that must repair as many vases as possible within the alloted time. Each of them depicts yokais/onis in its forms and drawings, which gives a hint as to the "puzzle" minigame related to each vase. After completing the minigame, the player must click on the golden paintbrush strokes to rebuild the vase. Kintsugi is designed for mobile devices, thus giving the general public a kindly approach to japanese culture and its mythical stories. Play Kintsugi and unravel the secrets of a millenary art.
